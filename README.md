# More Drugs
Have you ever thought how much it sucks that most drugs can incur heavy penalties after just one use, especially in A16? Have you ever wondered why we don't have an antibiotic with *somewhat* realistic effects? Have you ever wanted to snort a freaking Thrumbo horn?

**Well fear not, for I bring you More Drugs!**

Rise and shine motherhumper! Take one of these beautiful orange pills and brighten your day, Sunrise™ was made just for you!

*Made by refining the finest powder of white gold supplied by your friendly neighborhood junkie plantation, mixed with some high-tech stuff and cooked over burning Raiders, this stuff will surely make your life easier! Side effects? What side effects? This stuff is an accepted drug on Glitterworlds, boy, like cigarettes were back on Earth in the 21th century. Except this has less cancer! What are you waiting for? Go out and buy some Sunrise™ today!*

Ever felt like you're about to go Berserk because those damn sensory mechanites hurt like hell? Ever wondered why you have to watch the slow death of your friend just because he caught the Flu and the next day he caught the Plague too? Do you hate Penoxycyline? Well then, I've got you covered!

*Time to take the red pill and I'll guarantee this antibiotic will clean your system faster than Neo dodges bullets! Cure Pill™ will fix you right up, buddy. What, you're in pain? No problem, this stuff has painkillers in it too! Listen to Morpheus and take the red pill today! Just don't forget that antibiotics will temporarily blow your own immune system back to the stone age too!*

Looking at that Thrumbo horn, no traders in a decade, and you want to get something out of it? Well, it's time to experiment!

*Ground that horn, take a sniff and you too can feel the power of this ancient beast! Get that combat edge you need to overcome any obstacles! Take one sniff and be great. Take two and become a god! Who needs that puny Go-Juice when you can have this? Snort the horn and lead the charge! What could possibly go wrong, right?*

These goodies also come with their own respective research.

**However, all this stuff comes at a cost. In this case the cost is the Tech Tree.**
Since the current iteration isn't exactly mod-friendly, especially not so when we include several mods, I didn't even bother with coordinates. So please use a mod that reverts the Tech Screen to pre-A16 state. Honestly, since Tynan is a cool guy who wants the game to be mod-friendly, the Tech Tree will change anyway so it isn't such a huge loss.
I personally recommend skyarkhangel's **[Old style research menu mod](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=28609.0)**.

## Balance
Really not sure about this one. Sunrise™ is probably a bit too powerful right now and I might have to add Neutroamine to the recipe of Cure Pill™ too. Thrumbo Powder should be ok, it's a rare substitute for Go-Juice. Only time can tell if I got the balancing right. And feedback, of course.

## Textures
The texture files for Sunrise and Cure Pill are based on some vanilla RimWorld textures. All I did was some slight changes and recoloring. The Thrumbo Powder one is self-made. Feel free to do whatever you want with them as long as you don't claim you made them.

## Compatibility
I honestly can't think of anything that would be incompatible with this.
