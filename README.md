# More Drugs
Have you ever thought how much it sucks that most drugs can incur heavy penalties after just one use, especially in A16? Have you eve wondered why we don't have an antibiotic with *somewhat* realistic effects?

Well fear not, for I bring you More Drugs!

Rise and shine motherhumper! Take one of these beautiful orange pills and brighten your day, Sunrise™ was made just for you!

Side effects? What side effects? This stuff is an accepted drug on Glitterworlds, boy, like cigarettes were back on Earth in the 21th century. Except this has less cancer! What are you waiting for? Go out and buy some Sunrise™ today!

Ever felt like you're about to go Berserk because those damn sensory mechanites hurt like hell? Ever wondered why you have to watch the slow death of your friend just because he caught the Flu and the next day he caught the Plague? Do you hate Penoxycyline? Well then, I've got you covered!

No problem, this stuff has painkillers in it too! Listen to Morpheus and take the red pill today! Just don't forget that antibiotics will temporarily blow your own immune system back to the stone age too!

# Balance
Really not sure about this one. Sunrise™ is probably a bit too powerful right now and I might have to add Neutroamine to the recipe of Cure Pill™ too. Only time can tell. And feedback, of course.

# Textures
The texture files included are based on some vanilla RimWorld textures. All I did was some slight changes and recoloring. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

# Compatibility
I honestly can't think of anything that would be incompatible with this.
